### Usage
Just clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser of choice. Most of the configuration is in `script.js` and styles are in `style.css`. Styling things related to the search bar is done through `trystan.css`.

### Advanced Search
The default search engine is **Google**, but flags can be used to change this. Simply type the flag into the search bar and the search engine will automatically change when you press space.

The search engine does not persist on reload. `-x` can be used to switch the search engine back to **Google**.

### Known Bugs
* The order that the search flags display is a bit funky.
